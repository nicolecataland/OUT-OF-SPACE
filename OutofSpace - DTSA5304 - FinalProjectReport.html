Opportunities to witness rocket launches have gone from several times a year to several times a week. However, while this increase in the number of objects being launched into space has been widely reported, far less attention has been given to the increase of objects falling back down from space.</span></p><p class="c0 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All objects in orbit are being pulled back down towards Earth by Earth&#39;s gravity.* The high speeds at which these objects are inserted into orbit allow them to counter this effect and stay in space by moving fast enough to keep &quot;falling around&quot; the planet. Over time, though, tiny amounts of air resistance in the upper atmosphere cause these objects to slowly lose speed, and consequently, altitude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most objects burn up completely due to atmospheric friction as they descend, but sometimes larger or sturdier pieces survive and impact the ground. Just last year, a 11cm discarded battery component released from the International Space Station crashed through the roof and floor of a Naples, Florida home. Fortunately no one was injured, but the incident demonstrated how even a relatively small object can cause considerable damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reentries can be controlled, meaning engineers plan them carefully and aim for safe places like oceans. But many&mdash;like the discarded ISS component&mdash;are uncontrolled, making it hard to predict exactly where leftover pieces might land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c14">(*</span><span class="c18 c29 c14">Technically</span><span class="c14 c18">&nbsp;there&#39;s never a point in space where the gravitational effect of Earth on an object is zero, no matter how </span><span class="c14">far out you go</span><span class="c18 c14">. But that&#39;s another </span><span class="c14">conversation</span><span class="c18 c14">.) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.3754fbunmdqz"><span class="c11 c28">Mission Objective</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">*visualization goal*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My goal for this final project was to help close the aforementioned knowledge gap by developing a data visualization for a general audience that would educate and bring awareness to space object reentry trends.

Many of the data attributes, like the disposal/de-orbit method codes, are highly technical and would likely fail to convey any meaningful information to non-expert users*. Most people likely only care to know: </span><span class="c29">Was the space object reentry controlled or uncontrolled? </span><span class="c1">To better serve this audience, some data simplification and restructuring was necessary before it would be ready for visualization. (More on that later.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.7ywsew3k8bsd"><span class="c11">Visual Flight Plan</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c3">*the what and why*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the goal in mind and data in hand, I was then able to proceed with outlining the visualization tasks. As previously mentioned, my objective was to create an educational data visualization about space object reentries. In terms of task-driven design, the intended purpose is largely presentation and enjoyment, though I hoped to accommodate data exploration as well by including interactive elements and filtering in the design. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c17">*the who and when*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Designing a visualization for such purposes liberated me to be a bit more creative than if I was designing a visualization to help facilitate a specific business function ( ..though still obligated to present the data as honestly and faithfully as possible, of course!) That is not to say however that it would be without challenge. My attempts to elicit visualization tasks from peers did not come up too fruitful. Most individuals were not familiar enough with space object reentries to even know the questions they would want to ask. &nbsp;That being said, this effort did indicate to me that my target users would probably not be as interested in aspects like object&rsquo;s type or orbit as they are to know simply how big the object is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Researching existing space object re-entries visualizations also yielded only line and bar charts. While this type of visualization does effectively illustrate the reentry temporal trends I wanted to communicate, I wasn&#39;t confident it would hold my target user&#39;s attention. This made me determined to come up with a way to present the data that was more visually compelling and engaged the user. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c17 c3">*the how and where*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since I was assuming my target audience had no prior knowledge about space object reentries, I knew I would need to contextualize my data. I took a great deal of inspiration from digital publications like The Pudding, that use &quot;scrollytelling&quot; techniques to tell data-driven stories. Employing a similar strategy would allow me to provide a narrative that would guide the user&#39;s action and navigation through the data, without overwhelming the user with too much information at once. I determined that using time as an absolute reference for my data would be the most conducive frame for this approach. I also knew that an object&#39;s mass and disposal/de-orbit method would need to be reflected in the visualization, as these were the attributes most closely associated with a re-entering space object&#39;s risk factor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.m6pu6sdu62dj"><span class="c11">Final Countdown</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c5">*constructing the visualization*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Though the tasks I had outlined earlier served as an accurate guidepost throughout the development of my visualization, there were still many scrapped design sheets and prototypes involved before reaching the final design implementation. For one thing, I am much more comfortable in a Python development environment, but it was quickly evident that in order to implement the dynamic visualization I had been envisioning, I would need something that would allow for more flexibility. &ldquo;Always use the right tool for the job&rdquo; is advice that has yet to steer me wrong, and so I landed on D3 (a Javascript library) to get it done. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 592.50px; height: 376.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 592.50px; height: 376.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Some early (and fortunately abandoned) design ideas for my visualization. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Another challenge I encountered during development was that I had been too ambitious in trying to maintain my data&rsquo;s granularity. Inspired by data visualizations like </span><span class="c11 c15"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pudding.cool/2024/11/love-songs/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1745971027987044&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ILVuAk0qsewgJNtN4eYqW">this one</a></span><span class="c1">, I had sought to retain and display all of the individual object data points in my visualization. This resulted in overly cluttered early prototypes with terrible load time and performance. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I ultimately was able to resolve this issue by opting to filter out all objects with a mass below the threshold that would trigger a U.S. Space Command Public Reentry Tracking Alert (3000kg). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I also discovered in this process that including the launch date of the space object in my visualization design wasn&rsquo;t adding any meaningful knowledge or insight opportunities to the graphic. Instead just plotting the reentry date of the object resulted in a much cleaner, easy to intuit design. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.yhlh5mxxi678"><span class="c9">Liftoff </span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">*key elements of the final visualization design*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The final design is an interactive timeline, supplemented with narrative cards that provide context as the user navigates through the data. To further support this narrative flow, I oriented the timeline vertically instead of along the more common x-axis. This made for a more natural and intuitive scrolling experience for the user exploring the data. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 737.50px; height: 352.25px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.gif" style="width: 737.50px; height: 352.25px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Screen recording of the space object reentry timeline visualization. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The user is able to hover over any data point in the visualization to reveal a tooltip containing all of the reentry details of that object, including its country of origin and if it was a controlled or uncontrolled reentry. The size of each data point in the visualization directly corresponds to that object&rsquo;s reentry mass. With our lecture on ethical visualization practices in mind, I took great care to ensure that the mass of the object</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">mapped to the area</span><span>&nbsp;of the circle and </span><span class="c11">not the diameter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to avoid misrepresenting the data. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.9ivtaezg43qe"><span class="c9">Systems Review</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">*design evaluation*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Given my visualization purpose was largely for presentation and enjoyment, I determined the design evaluation would lend itself better to the more informal methodologies, over something like a controlled lab study. However to make sure the evaluation was nonetheless rigorous, I opted for an approach that combined quantitative and qualitative measures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I conducted an observational study on my participant users by observing how they interacted with and navigated through the visualization, which definitely didn&rsquo;t make them uncomfortable at all. (The observational study was also convenient given the visualization is hosted locally on my laptop.) I also asked one participant to &ldquo;think aloud&rdquo; as they engaged with the visualization to see if it would reveal additional insight. Additionally, I conducted post-session interviews with all participants to solicit any thoughts, questions, and impressions they had after using the tool. Lastly, to have a quantitative measure, I gave all participants a 3 question survey that asked the user to rate on a scale of 1 to 5: how engaging they found the visualization, how easy it was to understand the visualization, and if they felt they gained new knowledge through the visualization. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.vn89s9yxp6cr"><span class="c9">Mission Accomplished</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">*evaluation results*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Though the inherent bias in my participant user selection threatened the reliability of my results, the evaluation process yielded many surprising insights. I had been concerned about overwhelming the user with too many data dimensions, but all participants reported wanting more filtering options. This is something I would definitely include in future iterations. The survey also proved very valuable. Some participants appeared to be more willing to express they struggled to understand the visual in the survey than they were in the other evaluation formats. All participants reported having more knowledge about space object reentries after engaging with the visualization&ndash;which I think makes it a success!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c13" id="h.q8r41a15xoy4"><span class="c9">Back to Earth</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">*concluding remarks*</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thank you for taking the time to read and review this report! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The relevant scripts and data involved in producing the data visualization and this report can be found in </span><span class="c11 c15"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/nicolecataland/OUT-OF-SPACE&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1745971027998220&amp;usg=AOvVaw1d24DZMx629d_sL7t6opHU">this repository</a></span><span>.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(https://github.com/nicolecataland/OUT-OF-SPACE). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p></body></html>
